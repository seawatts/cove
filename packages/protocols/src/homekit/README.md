# HomeKit Protocol

HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) is Apple's protocol for smart home device communication.

## Features (Planned)

- HAP server implementation
- Accessory discovery and pairing
- Characteristic subscriptions
- Secure communication
- Siri integration support

## Key Benefits

- **Apple Ecosystem**: Native integration with iOS, macOS, tvOS
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption
- **Local Control**: Works without internet
- **Siri Support**: Voice control built-in

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Not yet implemented**

May be superseded by Matter implementation, as Matter provides HomeKit compatibility.

If implemented separately, will likely use:
- `hap-nodejs` for HAP server
- Bonjour/mDNS for device discovery
- Bridge pattern to expose Cove devices

## Relationship to Matter

Matter includes HomeKit compatibility by default. This dedicated HomeKit implementation may not be necessary if Matter support is added first.
