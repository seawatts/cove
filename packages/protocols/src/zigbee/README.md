# Zigbee Protocol

Zigbee is a low-power, low-bandwidth mesh networking protocol widely used in smart home devices.

## Features (Planned)

- Zigbee2MQTT integration
- ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation) support
- Device pairing and discovery
- Mesh network management
- OTA firmware updates

## Key Benefits

- **Low Power**: Battery-powered devices can last years
- **Mesh Network**: Self-healing, extends range through repeaters
- **Wide Adoption**: Thousands of compatible devices
- **Local Control**: No cloud required

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Not yet implemented**

Planned for future release. Will likely integrate with:
- Zigbee2MQTT for MQTT-based control
- ZHA for direct USB coordinator support
- zigbee-herdsman library

## Hardware Requirements

- Zigbee USB coordinator (e.g., ConBee II, Sonoff Zigbee 3.0)
- Or integration with existing Zigbee2MQTT instance
