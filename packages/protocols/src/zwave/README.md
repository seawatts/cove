# Z-Wave Protocol

Z-Wave is a wireless mesh networking protocol designed for home automation, operating on sub-GHz frequencies.

## Features (Planned)

- Z-Wave JS integration
- Device inclusion/exclusion
- Mesh network management
- Secure S2 pairing
- OTA firmware updates
- Network health monitoring

## Key Benefits

- **Mesh Network**: Self-healing, extends range through repeaters
- **Low Interference**: Sub-GHz spectrum (868/908 MHz)
- **Interoperability**: Z-Wave Alliance certification
- **Security**: S2 security framework

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Not yet implemented**

Planned for future release. Will likely integrate with:
- Z-Wave JS for modern Z-Wave support
- Z-Wave USB controller (700/800 series)

## Hardware Requirements

- Z-Wave USB controller (e.g., Aeotec Z-Stick 7, Zooz ZST10)
- Or integration with existing Z-Wave JS instance
