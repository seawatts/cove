# Cove - Modern Home Assistant Alternative

> A self-hosted home automation platform that combines the power of Home Assistant with modern web technologies and automatic device discovery

## What is Cove?

Cove is a **modern, self-hosted alternative to Home Assistant** that brings together:

- **üöÄ Hub Daemon**: Lightweight Bun-powered daemon that runs on Raspberry Pi or any Linux device
- **üîç Automatic Discovery**: mDNS-based device discovery (no manual configuration needed)
- **üèóÔ∏è Entity-First Architecture**: Home Assistant-inspired but modernized with TypeScript
- **üíé Beautiful UI**: Next.js 15 web app with real-time updates and modern design
- **üîå Multi-Protocol**: ESPHome, Philips Hue, with Matter/Zigbee coming soon
- **üè† Self-Hosted**: Your data stays on your hardware (with optional cloud sync)
- **‚ö° Developer-Friendly**: TypeScript throughout, modern tooling with Bun

## Cove vs Home Assistant

| Feature | Cove | Home Assistant |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Runtime** | Bun (fast, modern) | Python (slower startup) |
| **UI Framework** | Next.js 15 + React 19 | Custom Python web framework |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB | SQLite (limited scalability) |
| **Device Discovery** | Automatic mDNS scanning | Manual configuration |
| **Mobile Apps** | Native iOS + React Native | Companion apps |
| **Development** | TypeScript monorepo | Python + YAML |
| **Performance** | Sub-second startup | 30+ second startup |
| **Entity Architecture** | Modernized HA patterns | Legacy patterns |

## Architecture

Cove uses a **Home Assistant-inspired entity-first architecture** with modern improvements:

### Hub Daemon (Raspberry Pi / Linux)
- **Bun Runtime**: Fast, modern TypeScript execution (sub-second startup)
- **Hub V2 Architecture**: Simplified, event-driven architecture with EventBus, Registry, StateStore, and CommandRouter
- **Entity Discovery**: Automatic discovery of entities within devices (sensors, lights, switches)
- **Protocol Support**: ESPHome, Hue, Matter, Zigbee, and more
- **SQLite Database**: In-memory SQLite with WAL mode for fast entity state snapshots and telemetry
- **Local API**: WebSocket and REST for real-time entity control
- **Standalone Binary**: Compiles to single executable (no Node.js required)
- **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite with mock drivers for reliable testing

### Web Application
- **Next.js 15 PWA**: Modern React 19 with server-side rendering
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for instant state changes
- **Entity Management**: Beautiful UI for controlling all your devices
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Offline Support**: PWA capabilities for offline device control

### Cloud (Optional)
- **Entity Sync**: Keep entity states synchronized across clients
- **User Management**: Secure authentication with Clerk
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant entity state changes
- **Works Offline**: Cloud enhances experience but isn't required

### Mobile Apps
- **iOS App**: Native Swift application with widgets and HomeKit integration
- **Android App**: React Native (coming soon)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
# Configure your Supabase and Clerk credentials
# See apps/hub/src/env.ts for all required environment variables
bun db:push
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
bun dev:hub
```

#### Run the Web App
```bash
bun dev:next
```

## Development Commands

### Hub Development
```bash
bun dev:hub              # Start hub daemon with hot reload
bun build:hub            # Build hub for deployment
bun build:hub:linux-arm64 # Build for Raspberry Pi
```
